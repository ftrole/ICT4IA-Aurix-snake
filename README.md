# Snake on an Aurix board: ICT for Industrial Application project
The aim of this project is to implement the snake game on an Aurix board, using a joystick to drive the snake and a 8x8 led matrix with MAX7219 driver to display the game.

This repository contains 2 projects:
- [Snake_Game_KIT_TC375_LK](./Snake_Game_KIT_TC375_LK): for Aurix kit TC375 LK, snake game that prints the gameboard on the console.
- [Snake_Game_KIT_TC397_TFT](./Snake_Game_KIT_TC397_TFT): for Aurix kit TC395 TFT, that displays the game on the led panel.

For a more detailed description of the implementation you can read [this report](./report/report.pdf).

***NOTE***: these projects are just Proofs of Concept: a relevant part of the code have been taken from the [Aurix code Example repository](https://github.com/Infineon/AURIX_code_examples/tree/master/code_examples) from Infineon and adapted for our purpose.
